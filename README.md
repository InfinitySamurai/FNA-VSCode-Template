# FNA VSCode Template
Start new FNA projects quickly and easily with handy setup scripts, a versatile boilerplate project, and convenient Visual Studio Code integration.

## Features ##
- Super simple setup scripts that download and install FNA and its native libraries for you!
- Boilerplate project already included -- no need to wrestle with MSBuild configurations or writing yet another Game1 class.
- Visual Studio Code tasks for building and running your game, cleaning/restoring your project, and compiling .fx files!
- In-editor debugging support with the Mono Debugger.
- Supports Windows and macOS!

## Prerequisites ##
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [C# Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
  - [Mono Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.mono-debug) (required for macOS debugging -- [Windows can use `clr` instead](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework))
- [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/mac/) (required for MacOS)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) (required for Windows to decompress fnalibs)
- [Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) (required for building effects -- on Mac, [you can use Wine to run this](https://github.com/AndrewRussellNet/FNA-Template#linuxmacos-installing-the-directx-sdk-on-wine))

## Setup Instructions ##
1. Download and unzip the ZIP archive.
2. Copy+paste the resulting folder to your desired project directory.
3. Run `./getFNA.sh` (macOS) or `./win_getFNA.ps1` (Windows PowerShell) to download the latest FNA and fnalibs to the directory. (You can run this script again if you want to update either FNA or the libraries at a later point.)
4. Rename `project_name` to your project's name (the folder and the csproj file)
5. Open the newly-renamed project folder (NOT the root folder!) in Visual Studio Code.
6. Do a Find+Replace for "project_name" (case sensitive!) to the new name of your project.
7. Run the "Restore Project" build task.

That's it! Now you're ready to build and run the base project!

## Build Tasks ##
- **Restore Project:** Restores the .csproj. Run this before building for the first time, and run it again whenever you change the .csproj file.
- **Build (Debug/Release):** Builds the project with the specified configuration but does not run it. This also copies over everything in the Content/ subdirectory and the fnalibs.
- **Build and Run (Debug/Release):** Builds and runs the project. On MacOS, it runs the output with Mono. On Windows, it runs the output with .NET Framework.
- **Clean Project:** Cleans the output directories and all their subdirectories.
- **Build Effects:** Runs `fxc.exe` on all of the `.fx` files found in the Content/ subdirectories and outputs corresponding `.fxb` files that can be loaded through the Content Manager at runtime.
- **Build Content:** Runs good old MGCB.exe on the Content.mgcb file
- **Force Build Content:** Force builds the content (MGCB.exe -r)
